			<h3>
				The challenge...
			</h3>
			<p>
				Imagine you have &#163;1 million to lend, and several thousand people who want to borrow it. Your challenge is to devise a solution that helps ensure the right people get the money - in this case, "the right people" means those who are going to pay it back (with interest)!
			</p>
			<p>
				We will provide you with a big lump of data on the (anonymous) applicants. For a subset of this data, we will also tell you the decision made on them by a real personal loans provider, and how well they're behaving as customers so far. We'll also give you some examples of real world loan application websites and decision systems.
			</p>
			<p>		
				Exactly how you tackle the challenge is up to you. If machine learning floats your boat, you may use your time to evolve an algorithm that works out which data points are the best predictors of future performance. Or perhaps you will build a plugin that augments the data with a rich vein of data scraped from social media platforms. If you are web or mobile app development fanatics, perhaps you will build a truly awesome application process or a world-class API. Or maybe data visualisation is your passion, and you'll develop the sweetest of dashboards to report on application stats and account performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The judges will assess each solution based on its own merits, but will be most impressed by solutions that demonstrate the best way to maximise return on the theoretical &#163;1 million loan fund.  You can still win first prize if the judges believe that your solution is genuinely innovative or well built, but can't quite prove itself against the data provided.
			</p>
			<h3>
				The prize...
			</h3>
			<p>
				We are excited to be able to offer a fantastic prize of an <a href="https://www.oculus.com/dk2">Oculus Rift DK2</a> Virtual Reality headset for EVERY member of the winning team (up to 4 people). That's one each, not one to share - worth over &#163;300 each!

			<h2>.NET Developer</h2>
			<h3>Nottingham City Centre</h3>
			<h4>Excellent salary, bonus and career opportunities</h4>
			<p>
				We are seeking the best .NET developers and technical architects in the Nottingham area for a new Financial Services technology startup. Whether you are a recent graduate or a seasoned professional with years of enterprise development under your belt, you will already be in a position where you are helping to set up the technical agenda for your team.
			</p>
			<ul>
					<li>You will consider yourself to be amongst the best in your peer group, and will have an instinctive understanding of what constitutes great software design</li>
					<li>You will be passionate about using industry best practices, including the SOLID principles and recognised design patterns, and will know how to apply them in an enterprise .NET environment</li>
					<li>You will be obsessed with code testability, continuous integration and automation, and will be constantly thinking with your 'DevOps' head on.  In other words, you recognise that software should be designed to be used and managed by others, not just to pass QA</li>
					<li>Although you may have a specialism in ASP.NET MVC, WPF, enterprise middleware design, or database/BI design, you will nevertheless have plenty to say about all the layers in the application stack.  This will be evident in the fact that those around you seek out and value your opinions and advice</li>
					<li>Even if you have not worked in an agile environment, you will understand the principles, and will already operate with a delivery mindset.  You will be equally comfortable conversing with other IT professionals, business stakeholders and end users</li>
					<li>If you recognise yourself in this description, we will offer you a fantastic opportunity to join a greenfield project in Nottingham City Centre, working alongside a group of talented, passionate software professionals and Financial Services experts</li>
					<li>You will have access to the latest tools and technologies, and will have the opportunity to work on exciting projects that include high-profile websites, service-oriented architectures, 'big data' projects and mobile apps.  You will also experience working in a truly agile development environment</li>
					<li>As you will be joining a technology startup, you will have every chance (and will be expected to) contribute heavily to the future direction of the company.  Your opportunities to progress your career will be limited only by yourself and your desire to be the best</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				Join us today, and six months from now, your friends will be begging you to get them in too!
